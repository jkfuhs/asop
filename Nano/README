Usage:
Run the DFS_nav.py script on the nano when it boots. It will use the coordinates
from field_coordinates.txt to map out the field. The first coordinate should be
the southwest most point and the second coordinate should be the northeast most
point. Anything south or west of the first coordinate or north or east of the
second coordinate is out of bounds. Place the relatively central in the field to start.
(At least 10m from the boundary).
